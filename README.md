# netflix-clone

Our second school project for ROC Kop van Noord-Holland ICT software developer.
Our project has to include: HTML, CSS, PHP and a Database.
This project is created by: Marcel, Gino and Jack.
We are first year students

Our plan was to recreate the famous entertaining platform called Netflix.
This is an challenging and an interesting project as most of us haven't been familier with PHP and databases.

Our plan is to include:
- Login page;
- Register page;
- Main page;
- Search function;
- Trailers;
- Seasons;
- Videos;
- Accounts;
- Timeline of already watched video.
